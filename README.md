## Usage Instructions
### Setup as an OBS Browser source
In OBS, add a new source to your scene of type `Browser`. In the `URL` field, type:

Replace `YourTwitchUsername` with your actual Twitch username.

## For programmers: Building Instructions
If you want to run the server yourself, 
- install the dependancies with `npm install`,
- create a file `openai_api_key` in the top level directory, 
- run the server with `node server.js`, and
- connect to `localhost:3000/?username=YourTwitchUsername`

There are three main files to concern yourself with, `server.js`, `public/app.js`, and `public/index.html`.
